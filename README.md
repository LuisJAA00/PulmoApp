# Pulmo App

Our team developed a cross-platform application for respiratory health monitoring, built with React and Appwrite, aimed at enhancing the connection between personal patient tracking and medical evaluation.  

# Purpose 
Our project seeks to create a system aimed at respiratoryproblems, specifically in the upper and lower respiratorytract. The main objective is to develop a therapeuticsystem that helps patients to recover their respiratorycapacity by means of high frequency vibrations. Inaddition, the system will record and store respiratoryvolumes, which will allow therapy to be carried out remotely, without the need for patients to visit healthcare
centres. In addition to addressing health problems, our
project will promote the integration of digital tools,
medical records and information systems. With the
development of this therapy device, we seek to
specifically address issues arising from diseases such as
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
and the increasingly prevalent post-COVID-19
complications. (Molina-Molina, 2020). Our project
targets a wide range of patients, including elderly people
with respiratory impairment. The design of our device,
unlike others that work with percussions, allows elderly
people to be candidates for this type of therapy, as it does
not generate shocks to the rib cage. It can also be directed
to patients recovering from respiratory infections,
procedures that required intubation, and as mentioned
before, patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as
asthma, COPD or some form of pulmonary fibrosis. In
addition to addressing health problems, our project will
promote the integration of digital tools, medical records,
and information systems. These systems will help to
eliminate inequalities and structural barriers, such as
gender differences, market segmentation, economic
inequalities, etc. In terms of gender and market
segmentation, we are looking for a design that can be
adapted to the user's body depending on their physical
characteristics. Likewise, this device could even be used
by athletes or professionals who are exposed to
continuous respiratory stress. People with limited access
to healthcare, such as those in rural areas, who need
remote treatment solutions. By providing an accessible,
non-invasive, technology-driven solution, we aim to
improve the quality of life of these people while reducing
hospitalization rates.
By ensuring a people-cantered approach, we aim to
improve the effectiveness of health programs, enhance
real-time monitoring, and improve the management of
healthcare resources. This digital transformation will
modernize data systems, improving healthcare access and
performance.

# Therapy

The therapy will last a total of 30 minutes, during which:

    Every 2.5 minutes, there will be a progressive change in the motor vibrations (these changes do not affect how the patient is supposed to breathe).

    Ideally, a countdown timer should be included so that the patient knows how much time remains in the session. It could also display calming messages like “Only 5 minutes left!” or “Almost done!” — anything to help keep the patient relaxed.

To measure lung volumes:
The patient's breaths (inhalations and exhalations) will be recorded for 1 minute before and 1 minute after the therapy (2 minutes total).
Assuming approximately 15 breaths per minute (4 seconds per breath — 2 to inhale, 2 to exhale), the breathing pattern per minute would be:

    5 normal breaths (20 seconds)

    1 forced inhalation (10 seconds)

    1 forced exhalation (10 seconds)

    5 normal breaths (20 seconds)

For both the therapy and the lung volume measurements, the same animation can be reused during the normal breathing phases.
